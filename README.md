Parasympathetic withdrawal and reduced cognitive performance in the ageing brain: network graph representing correlations between clusters of variables.
Each variable is represented as a node, and edges are drawn between nodes when the absolute correlation exceeded a predefined threshold (|r| > 0.4).
Node colors reflected their cluster assignment from hierarchical clustering- Wardâ€™s D2 method.
Edge width is proportional to the magnitude of the correlation. 
Green edges represent positive correlations, while blue negative correlations (Spearman's Rho). 
Network visualizations were generated using the visNetwork package in R.
